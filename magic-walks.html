                        Japanese garden are designed to be contemplative spaces that allow you to escape from the
                        outside world and to connect with nature. They are often associated with Zen Buddhism and reflect its principles of
                        simplicity and mindfulness.
                        In addition to their aesthetic value, Japanese gardens are also created with specific principles in mind, such as
                        asymmetry, borrowed scenery, and the use of negative space. These principles aim to create a sense of tranquility and
                        harmony within the garden.
                        <br>Japanese gardens are admired and appreciated for their beauty, serenity, and ability to transport visitors to a place of
                        peace and tranquility.
